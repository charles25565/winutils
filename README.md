# winutils

These are UNIX core utilities (from Suckless' sbase) for Windows using Cygwin. These are built on Server 2019 x64 and thus should work on any Windows version 1809 and above, and in theory anything that Cygwin currently supports, provided the Windows version is 64-bit.

We provide each file seperately. When using this you will almost certainly need the Cygwin DLL, you can place it where you will keep the executables or in System32.
